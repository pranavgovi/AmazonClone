This is an amazon clone app . I coded this app to get hold of react js. I was able to learn this react amazon clone with the help of "Clever programmer Youtube tutorial".

This app conists of a home page where users can view the products and also can add it to cart.
There is a checkout page as well.

Learnings:
I learnt about state management in react js . In this code, it is done using react context API. I was able to learn about reducer functions, initial states and  children.
Created state provider hooks for Basket (to store the cart items ) and also created a variable for user.
